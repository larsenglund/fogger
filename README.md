# Fogger
A cheap DIY fog machine.

## Hardware
The basic fog machine consists of
* Grill lighter, $15
* Copper fuel pipe (6mm outer diameter, 5m long), $22
* Thermocouple thermometer, $4
* Pump (self priming, 6mm outer diameter inlet and outlet, 12V), $4
* 12V adapter, $3
* PVC tube (5mm inner diameter), $3
* Aluminium foil
* Metal wire
* Rockwool insulation
* About 1 liter of sand
Total cost: $51 (assuming you have the last four items on the list, if not rockwool might be the hardest to come by in small quantities)

The upgraded version with automatic temperature control, display and WiFi remote control removes the "manual" thermocouple thermometer and adds these things:
* Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266) $3
* MAX6675 Module + K Type Thermocouple, $5
* 2 channel relay module (3.3V), $3
* 5V charger, $2
* OLED display (0.91", 128x32, I2C), $2
Total cost for upgraded version: $62

Fog juice (smoke liquid) is made from
* Destilled water (4L), $4
* Glycerol (1L), $16
Total cost for 5L of 20% fog juice: $20
Fog juice can also be bought premade for about the same price but then you can't vary the concentration as easy.
